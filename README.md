## INTRODUCTION
TierraCrossSection is a cross-section that uses functions from original hapi. For general purpose we suggest using hapi at https://github.com/hitranonline/hapi.

It contains functionalities to generate different version of the cross-section for tierra, ,a transmission spectroscopy code that is developed by the disruptive planet group at EAPS, MIT. This code generates the cross-section database to be used into the transmission spectra with the transmission spectra using the HITRAN/HITEMP database.

RunScript.py was run in the MITSupercloud for generating cross-section corresponding to CS-DFLT, CS-1SUP, and CS-1SDN that are part of the Niraula & de Wit et al. 2022 publication work.

Other cross-sections requires making changes into the functions.
